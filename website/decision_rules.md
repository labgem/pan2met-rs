# Decision rules

This document aims to answer the following question: 
> What are the decision rules implemented in this version of `pan2met`?

## How to enable or disable a decision rule?

Each decision rule has an unique identifier.
To enable or disable a decision rule in the metabolic pathway inference, edit the configuration file section `rules` and add or remove the corresponding identifier.
You can use the file [`conf/example.yaml`](https://github.com/labgem/pan2met-rs/blob/main/conf/example.yaml)

For instance, a configuration file `configuration.yaml` with the following content would enable only the filter on transport pathwways and signaling pathway (`TransportPathway` and `SignalingPathway` rule identifiers), the filter of pathway with no catalysis evidence found (`AllReactionsMissing`) and would keep all pathways with all reactions catalyzed, or spontaneous (`AllReactionsCatalyzed`). 

## How does the inference algorithm work? 

The decision algorithm will pass in review each of the decision rules. Each of them have three possible outcomes. Either it accepts the pathway or rejects it, or does not return a decision otherwise. In the later case, the algorithm pass to the next decision rule.
The decision rules are ordered by an arbitrarily defined priority order.
If no decision rule accepted nor rejected the pathway at the end of the review, the pathway is rejected by default.

### A glimpse into the decision rules proposed

#### `TransportPathway` -- Reject the transport pathways

#### `SignalingPathway` -- Reject the signaling pathways

#### `AllReactionsCatalyzed` -- Accept a pathway when all its non spontaneous reactions are catalyzed

#### `AllReactionsMissing` -- Reject a pathway when none of its non spontaneous reactions is catalyzed

#### `KeyReaction`

#### `SynthesisMissingLast` -- Reject a biosynthesis pathway missing its last reaction.

**Rationale**: If the last reaction leading to the metabolite of interest is missing, it might be a sign that the metabolite is not synthesized in the organism, hence that the biosynthesis pathway is not there.

#### `DegradationMissingFirst` -- Reject a degradation pathway missing its last reaction

**Rationale**: If the first reaction in a degradation pathway, the one that initially transformed the metabolite targetted by the degradation pathway, is not catalyzed, it might be a sign that no such degradation occurs in the organism.

#### `EnergyMissingHalf` -- Reject an energy metabolism related pathway when half of its non spontaneous reactions lacks a catalyzis

**Rationale**: 

#### `PathwayScore` -- Accept the pathway if its pathway score exceeds a threshold

#### How is the PathwayScore computed?

The $PathwayScore$ is a score that aims at estimating how likely a pathway is to be effectively in the target organism metabolism.

The pathway score is a weighted sum of the $ReactionScore$.

$$
PathwayScore(Pathway) = \frac{\sum_{r \in Reaction(Pathway)} ReactionScore(r)}{|Reaction(Pathway)|}
$$

The \(ReactionScore\) is computed as follows:

\[
ReactionScore(reaction) = PresenceScore(reaction) + KeyReactionScore(reaction) + UniquenessScore(reaction) 
\]

The reaction score equals 0 if we did not find any evidence of a catalysis for this reaction.

Then, the \(ReactionScore\) components are computed as follows:
$$
PresenceScore(reaction) = 
\begin{cases}
0.2 & \text{ if we found enzymes catalyzing this reaction } \\
0 & \text{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
$$

The key reaction score is computed as 
$$
KeyReactionScore(reaction) =
\begin{cases}
0.5 & \text{ if the reaction is considered a 'key' reaction for the pathway in MetaCyc } \\
0 & \text{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
$$

The uniqueness score is computed as follows:
$$
UniquenessScore(reaction) =  - \exp(|Pathway(reaction)| / 10)
$$
where \(|Pathway(reaction)|\) is the number of pathway having the reaction \(reaction\).


##### How to choose a good threshold?

## Acknoledgments

Some of the decision rules implemented in `pan2met` are inspired by the decision rules used by the PathoLogic algorithm.

## What could cause an erroneous pathway prediction?

Unfortunately, there is are a lot of causes that might lead to an incorrect decision.

An incorrect decision is of two possible kinds:
A false positive is a pathway predicted to be in the metabolism, whereas it is not indeed realized by the organism metabolism.
A false negative, on the other hand, is a pathway that is rejected by `pan2met` decision rules, whereas it is indeed found in the organism's metabolism.

### Incorrect protein catalyzis annotation

`pan2met` relies on sequence homology method to associate biochemical reaction catalyzis to a protein. Two protein with similar sequence might however have distinct biochemical functions, which might fool pan2met into predicting more pathway than it should.

### Gene regulation

Even if the genome of an organism contains genes coding for enzymes of all catalyzed steps of a pathway, this does not necessarily implies that the pathway is indeed effective in the organism. For instance, there might be gene regulatory mechanism that disable synchronous enzyme expression thus limiting the potential of such a pathway.
